# Welcome to AI Classification Standard (AICS)

The AI Classification Standard (AICS) is an open framework for classifying and evaluating artificial intelligence systems. This documentation provides detailed information about our methodology, comparison with other standards, and our development roadmap.

## Why AICS Matters

In an era of rapid AI advancement, having a standardized classification system is crucial for:

- **Industry Clarity**: Providing a common language for discussing AI technologies and their applications
- **Policy Development**: Enabling informed decision-making for AI governance and regulation
- **Investment Guidance**: Helping stakeholders identify opportunities and assess risks
- **Research Direction**: Guiding academic and industry research priorities
- **Workforce Development**: Supporting education and training programs for AI careers
- **Global Collaboration**: Facilitating international cooperation in AI development

## Overview

The AICS framework provides a structured approach to understanding and categorizing the AI industry. It helps organizations:

- Navigate the complex AI landscape
- Make informed decisions about AI investments
- Understand relationships between different AI technologies
- Track industry trends and developments

## Framework Structure

AICS uses a two-layer classification system that aligns with broader industry standards while providing AI-specific granularity:

### Layer 1: Sectors
The top level consists of four main sectors that represent the core areas of AI development and application:

1. **AI Infrastructure (INF)**: Core technologies enabling AI development
2. **AI Models & Platforms (MOD)**: Foundation models and deployment platforms
3. **AI Applications & Services (APP)**: End-user solutions across industries
4. **AI Governance & Ethics (GOV)**: Responsible AI development and deployment

### Layer 2: Subsectors
Each sector is divided into specific subsectors that provide detailed classification of AI technologies and applications. For example:
- INF.CMP: AI Compute Hardware
- MOD.FND: Foundation Models
- APP.HLT: Healthcare AI
- GOV.AUD: AI Auditing & Compliance

## Integration with Other Standards

AICS is designed to complement existing industry classification systems:

- **GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard)**: AI is classified under Information Technology
- **NAICS (North American Industry Classification System)**: AI spans multiple sectors including Computer Systems Design and Scientific Research
- **ISIC (International Standard Industrial Classification)**: AI activities are distributed across Information Technology and Professional Services

The two-layer structure of AICS allows for:
- Easy mapping to broader classification systems
- Flexible integration with existing industry analysis frameworks
- Clear categorization of AI-specific activities
- Simple maintenance and updates as the industry evolves

## Methodology

Our classification system is built on four key principles:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear organization from sectors to subsectors
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Encompasses all major areas of AI development and application
3. **Practical Utility**: Designed for real-world use in industry analysis and decision-making
4. **Future-Proof**: Flexible enough to accommodate emerging technologies and trends

## Comparison with Other Standards

AICS differs from other AI classification systems in several ways:

- **Industry Focus**: Specifically designed for the AI industry, rather than general technology
- **Granular Classification**: More detailed subsector categorization for precise analysis
- **Practical Orientation**: Focus on real-world applications and business impact
- **Regular Updates**: Continuous refinement based on industry developments
- **Standard Alignment**: Designed to integrate with broader industry classification systems
