# Welcome to AI Classification Standard (AICS)

The AI Classification Standard (AICS) is a comprehensive framework for classifying and evaluating artificial intelligence systems. This documentation provides detailed information about our methodology, comparison with other standards, and our development roadmap.

## Overview

The AICS framework provides a structured approach to understanding and categorizing the AI industry. It helps organizations:

- Navigate the complex AI landscape
- Make informed decisions about AI investments
- Understand relationships between different AI technologies
- Track industry trends and developments

## Methodology

Our classification system is built on four key principles:

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Clear organization from broad sectors to specific subsectors
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Encompasses all major areas of AI development and application
3. **Practical Utility**: Designed for real-world use in industry analysis and decision-making
4. **Future-Proof**: Flexible enough to accommodate emerging technologies and trends

## Comparison with Other Standards

AICS differs from other AI classification systems in several ways:

- **Industry Focus**: Specifically designed for the AI industry, rather than general technology
- **Granular Classification**: More detailed subsector categorization for precise analysis
- **Practical Orientation**: Focus on real-world applications and business impact
- **Regular Updates**: Continuous refinement based on industry developments
