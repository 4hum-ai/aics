A comprehensive framework for classifying and evaluating artificial intelligence systems. AICS provides a structured approach to understanding the AI industry landscape, helping organizations navigate the complex world of artificial intelligence.

## üåü Features

- **Comprehensive Taxonomy**: Detailed classification of AI sectors and subsectors
- **Company Registry**: Curated database of Notable AI companies and their classifications
- **Open Standard**: Free to use and contribute to
- **Regular Updates**: Continuously evolving with the AI industry

## üìö Framework Overview

AICS is built upon the OECD's AI framework while extending it with industry-specific classifications. Our taxonomy is organized into four main sectors:

1. **AI Infrastructure (INF)**: Core technologies enabling AI development
2. **AI Models & Platforms (MOD)**: Foundation models and deployment platforms
3. **AI Applications & Services (APP)**: End-user solutions across industries
4. **AI Governance & Ethics (GOV)**: Responsible AI development and deployment

For detailed information about our taxonomy and methodology, visit our [documentation](https://4hum-ai.github.io/aics/).
